&nbsp;

## Overview

Bridge the gap between normal 3D Software and GameMaker by importing one of the many supported formats (including Community-made formats) and access its data all the same for every model.
- glTF 2.0
- OBJ
- Collada
- PICO CAD
- Crocotile 3D
- Blender 3D
- Nintendo NITRO
- SMF
- Penguin
- BBMOD
- Vertex Buffer

And then export the model into your own format to use in your GameMaker project.
Using [Catspeak](https://github.com/katsaii/catspeak-lang/tree/main) you can write your own import/export plugins and expand on the funcionality of this tool
